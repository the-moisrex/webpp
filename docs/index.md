## WEB++ (Modern C++ Web Framework)
Develop your backend, and God willing the front-end someday, with C++.

### Why C++?

Even though C++ practically runs the web, and you can see C++'s steps every step of the way that your request goes, from your browser to web servers,
people still think that C++ is not a good language for web development. It may have been true for a long time; but in the modern C++, we think C++ is
one of the best languages that can help you make the best websites and services.

C++ is good for web development because:

* It's as fast as a language can get
* It doesn't let you make stupid mistakes that a static analyzer can catch
* It can be run in unsafe environments since you don't have to share your source codes
* Has access to every corner of the operating system
* Has access to hardware like GPUs
* It can put life into the old codes
* You can run unsafe codes if your job depends on it :)
* Your web app doesn't have to re-run every time a request comes, it can remember everything
* Your website can be used in small IoT devices
* You can share your website's binaries and let the users run them in their own systems without sharing your sources
* It can run other languages; other languages use web servers that are written in C++ after all

I mean, C++ is already running the internet, it's a shame not to take over the web services too :)
