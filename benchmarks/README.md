# Web++ benchmarks
There have been many benchmarks done in order to write the best algorithms. Unfortunately 
some of them were done in temporarily files and folders and have been lost, but I've
decided to make this directory here to organize those benchmarks and make sure that all the
related benchmarks from now on goes here and can be used to check if they're correct on different
machines with different architectures, operating systems, hardware installed, software installed, and 
even different situations for example system load.

Unfortunately due to versioning, the old benchmarks have been lost or it's really hard to get to
them, that's why from now on there's going to be lots of code duplication and the benchmarks try to
copy and paste the important parts that require benchmarking so at least what was intended to be benchmarked
is not going to be lost after updates thus make the benchmarks faulty and even something un-compilable.

We try to put the results of those benchmarks on our machines in the README files in each directory
to make sure even if the benchmarks don't work the way they used to, the results of those benchmarks
will be preserved.
