     * clients because it can only respond to one server (well, usually).
     * Even though the design of the session manager and the connection type is designed in a way that
     * it can handle multiple request from multiple separate servers, but still a single fcgi session
     * manager should be able to handle multiple HTTP requests and not just one.
     * To solve this issue, it's better to have a "request manager" class as well.
